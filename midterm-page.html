        <p>Prepared for my midterm

        <p>
          Completed & double checked that I fully completed my part one of my Midterm &#128512;
          </p>

          <h2 style ="background-color:#3ac7e0;">How do I feel about COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>I am sending everyone the best; especiall those who must go out into the world daily to provide for themselves & their families</p>
        <p>
          I hope that the younger folks can <em>remain indoors</em> because it irritates & saddens me that people could careless about their <i>own</i> wellbeing & <i>others</i> wellbeing
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also strange how the news channels are causing so much commotion & possibly unnecessary commotion
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I did just realize that maybe this commotion is needed so people can finally stay in their homes, but then again the news is not the local/state government so what can they really do apart from comment
